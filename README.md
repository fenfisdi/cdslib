# CDSLib

Welcome to the Contagious Disease Simulation Library

This is an open source initiative made available to researchers, decision makers and the general public. In this library you will find two modules, each one addresses different epidemic modelling frameworks. The CDSLib_agents contains an agent based model describing contagion dynamic in different scenarios, from small compartments to cities. The ??? presents a dynamical deterministic model describing epidemics following a SEIRV

## History

This projects began as a voluntary initiative from some members of the Fundamentals and Teaching of Physics and Dynamical Systems Group (FEnFiSDi) from Universidad de Antioquia (UdeA) in March 2020 to bring our technical and theoretical skills on natural systems modelling to the emerging sanitary thread posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. After joining forces with the Epidemiology Group of UdeA and recruiting more members of orur research group, we begin a new face with funding from the National Ministry of Science and Technology and the National Learning Service. 

### Why open source?

We believe in the transformative power science has in society. We are committed to bring 

## Who we are

We are the Fundamentals and Teaching of Physics and Dynamical Systems Group from Universidad de Antioquia in Medellin Colombia. Our work ranges from research to science education. Our research has centered on gene regulatory networks, evolution of behaviour, city dynamics, weather and infeormation theory.

## Future Work

We pretend to extend our work beyond the COVID-19 pandemic to different diseases currently affecting human health or epidemics yet to come. According to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, future pandemics are expected to happen more often (https://www.ipbes.net/pandemics-media-release)
